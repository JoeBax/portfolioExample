        <p>I am currently working as a Business Analyst (so I am around developers, but I am never actually developing).  If you have nothing else to do feel free to check me out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-baxter/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. I don't have any other social media soooo... Yeah. No more social media links. Maybe look as some fun gifs on <a href="https://giphy.com/search/fun" target="_blank">Giphy</a>? </p>
